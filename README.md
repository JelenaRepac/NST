**Faculty Management System**

The Faculty Management System is a robust application designed to streamline the management of academic departments within an educational institution. The system focuses on organizing and maintaining information related to departments, subjects, and members (faculty) while ensuring a comprehensive historical record of key positions, such as heads and secretaries.

The Faculty Management System not only facilitates the organization and coordination of academic departments but also ensures a thorough documentation of faculty members' profiles, academic title changes, and the historical evolution of leadership roles within each department.
